# Sonnet-Automation
Tools designed to extract Resonant Frequency &amp; Coupling Quality Factor for Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector Simulations using a Sonnet .csv data file. 

The current scripts allow the extraction of Resonant Frqeuency &amp; Qc from a .csv data file exported from the EM Simulation Software Sonnet^{TM}.
